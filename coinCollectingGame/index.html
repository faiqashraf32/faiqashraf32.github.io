	<h2> This game cannot be played on mobile. Please come back to this page on your laptop or pc. </h2>
	<h2> How to play:</h2>
	<p> The game is simple. There are 3 levels. You will advance when you collect all of the coins on each level. If you get all the coins on all 3 levels, you win. If you hit a red lava block, you will die and will have to start that level over (so if you're on level 2 and die, you restart level 2 only). Have fun!
